Heya! thank you for thinking about creating your own module for Esofur!
since the base interpretor is written in Python, youll have to write the module in Python aswell,

Some things to keep in mind!
self.symbol_table is something
please do done() at the end of each "if" block



Template below
----------------------

if line.startswith("KEYWORD HERE"):
    print()
    #DO SOMETHING
    done()
